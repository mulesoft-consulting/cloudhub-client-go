# ANYPOINT CLIENT GO

This repository hosts golang modules to query resources on anypoint platform.

Each resource has its own module that was generated using [openapi-generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/).

## How to use

Include each module separately from your go project using

```golang
require github.com/mulesoft-anypoint/anypoint-client-go/[module_name] vx.x.x
```

As an example, if you wanted to import the version 1.0.1 of the `vpc` module you would need to use the following syntax:

```golang
require github.com/mulesoft-anypoint/anypoint-client-go/vpc v1.0.1
```

## Modules Versioning

Each module is released independently from the other, therefore each release is prefixed with the name of the module.

Examples :

```bash
vpc/v1.0.0
authorization/v2.2.0
```
